To replicate the *covariate adaptive randomization* procedure, you would need to:

1. *Randomize the first 10 participants* using simple random assignment (e.g., random number generator).
2. *Identify key covariates* to balance between groups:
    - Age
    - Sex assigned at birth
    - Pre-intervention IQ (RSPM)
    - Self-rated health (SF-36)
    - Behavioral performance (reaction time, accuracy)
    - Cognitive measurements (ERPs)
3. *For each new participant (from participant 11 onward)*:
    - Temporarily simulate assigning them to each group.
    - For each simulated assignment, run t-tests comparing covariates across groups.
    - Record the lowest p-value for each group assignment.
    - Assign the participant to the group with the *higher minimum p-value* (i.e., the assignment that leads to better covariate balance).
4. *Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each new enrollee.*

This method ensures group balance over time while allowing for continuous enrollment.



(we could randomize the first 10 as well but technically we already have participants in the study and its just ongoing)
